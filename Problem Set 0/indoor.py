"""Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user
for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace
should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user
explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

Here’s how to test your code manually:
Type HELLO and press Enter. Your program should output hello.
Type THIS IS CS50 and press Enter. Your program should output this is cs50.
Type 50 and press Enter. Your program should output 50."""

indoor_voice = input('').lower()
print(indoor_voice)
